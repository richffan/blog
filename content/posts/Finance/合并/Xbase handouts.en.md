 crack the logic of the 
consolidated statement. This move, my brother can do a year ago, and now 
he is more skilled.
The broken sword, in my opinion, is the cash flow. This time, we cracked 
the logic of Tianjian xbase. When we have cracked all the important financial 
skills, we will learn the "nine swords", and we will be able to truly laugh 
and be proud.
Tianjian's xbase method is the same as our template method logic, and the 
logic of working paper method is the same. Their essence is formula method:
Cash assets final number * * * * * * - cash assets regards * * * * = (liabilities 
final number - liabilities at the beginning) * * * * + (owner's equity final 
number * * * * - the beginning balance of owner's equity) - (non-cash assets 
final number * * * * - non-cash assets at the beginning) * *
Nearly all cash flows are prepared on the basis of this formula. In addition 
to the use of chronological accounting to specify, chronological accounting 
method has several drawbacks, masters generally do not use.
Now let's talk about the logic of xbase.

The above picture is the trial balance of Tianjian. xbase, analytical entry, 
analytical entry (comprehensive analysis), supplementary entry, cash flow 
statement and supplementary information are framed in red square, which are 
related to cash flow.
As long as we fill in the TB table, we can automatically generate the main 
table and schedule of the cash flow statement. The logic is the same as we 
talked about before, all the changes in the non-monetary funds account of 
the balance sheet (from the end of the period to the beginning of the period) 
are "rolled" into the corresponding cash flow item. For example, roll the 
"beginning to end" of accounts receivable to "cash received from sales of 
goods and services", and assign a cash flow item to each change of 
non-monetary funds account, and the final sum must be equal to the end of 
the monetary funds minus the beginning of the period.
Therefore, xbase can automatically generate a cash flow statement, as long 
as the TB is filled in, it can be produced. However, it is not accurate because 
it is rolled out and there are many special cases that are not taken into 
account. For example, in the above mentioned changes in accounts receivable, 
when there are bad debts, bad debts do not affect cash flow, it is not 
appropriate to put all changes in the "cash received from the sale of goods 
and services". So, how to solve this special situation? In this case, xbase 
is specifically designed to solve this situation.
In other words, the cash flow is "flattened" by the formula, and then 
corrected by xbase to bring it closer to the real situation. Therefore, the 
cash flow preparation process of Tianjian xbase is to first flatten and then 
adjust accurately.
(1) **xbase**
This table, as mentioned above, is used to adjust for special items, such 
as bad debts, depreciation, amortization, and debit and credit amounts 
belonging to different cash flow items. Because through the formula "rolled" 
out of the cash flow statement, can only "rolled" to a cash flow item, when 
the change of an account corresponds to a number of cash flow items, we can 
only "rolled" to one of them, which is not allowed. The function of Xbase 
is to solve the problem of "one to many", dispose of this "many", then the 
rolled out will be accurate.
(2) ** Analysis entry **
This table can clearly show which cash flow items belong to the changes in 
each balance sheet and income statement. In fact, you can fill it directly 
in this form, instead of xbase, because all the data in xbase will be linked 
to this table. So, why do you need xbase? The main reason is that the xbase 
data can be divided by subject. When the children fill out the manuscript, 
they will fill in the xbase of their own subjects. When the project manager 
compiles the cash flow, they just need to sum up the xbase filled by the 
children, and the cash flow statement will come out! The task of cash flow 
statement is assigned to each child, which reduces the burden of the project 
manager. The difficulty, however, is that xbase will not fill out the cash 
flow statement if the child does not understand the cash flow logic. My guess 
is that many of the kids in Tianjian don't understand the logic of xbase. 
Tianjian has a xbase for every subject. When I was in Tianjian, I never 
noticed it. I just don't know how to fill it in. If every child in Tianjian 
understands the principle of xbase, the children will compile xbase for their 
own subjects when making the manuscript, then the project manager will only 
need to sum up the xbase of each subject, and a fast and accurate cash flow 
statement will be produced.
Therefore, the little brother thinks that the role of xbase is to divide 
the work and assign the task of compiling cash flow to each child. I don't 
know if this is the original intention of the creators of xbase, but I think 
so.
With all that said, how do you fill out xbase?
To answer this question, we have to ask another question, using the template 
of Xbase to fill in the cash flow, can you fill in the cash flow?
If not, please learn my template first, and then learn xbase, which is the 
basis of my talk. You can learn the template method in an hour or two.
If you can, that's easy. Prove that you can fill in every subject. Since 
you know how to fill in each subject, you fill in the numbers on xbase until 
the numbers make the cash flow items in the ** Analysis entries ** table 
"assume the same results as I did in my template method".
Here are three examples to illustrate this.
**①Others should be **
Other receivables are divided into changes in original value and changes 
in allowance for doubtful accounts.
** CHANGE in Original Value **
In xbase, the original value change is "rolled" out. The logic is that if 
it ends up being positive, it is rolled over to the credit's "disbursement 
of other cash related to operating activities," and if it is negative, it 
is rolled over to "receipt of other cash related to operating activities."
If you want to put it in net, leave the original part alone and let it roll 
over to the rest of the "received" or "paid."
However, if we want to be precise and want to write in the amount incurred, 
we write in the amount incurred by the credit to the rest of the "received," 
and the formula automatically rolls out the remaining variation (i.e., the 
debit) to the rest of the "paid."
For example, if the original value of other receivables is 4 million debits 
and 3 million credits, without xbase, it will roll the 1 million changes 
directly into the rest of the payments from operating activities. If we want 
it to be shown as an amount incurred, we would put 3 million under "Recovery 
of other large operating amounts" of xbase's other receivables, as shown 
in the figure below.

When this is done, the xbase formula will automatically link the 3 million 
to the analysis entry, and then calculate the rest of the operating 
activities to become 4 million, and the result is the same as the template 
method we discussed earlier. The picture below is as follows.

** Change in Doubtful debts **
The change in bad debts of other receivables is rolled up to "cash paid for 
the purchase and construction of fixed assets, intangible assets and other 
long-term assets", and we look at the credit impairment loss later, which 
is also rolled up to "cash paid for the purchase and construction of fixed 
assets, intangible assets and other long-term assets". As long as the change 
of bad debt and the amount of credit impairment loss can be matched, they 
are rolled into the same cash flow project, the opposite direction of 
borrowing, it automatically offset the cash flow. This is similar to our 
template method, which also puts them in the same column, negative for debits 
and positive for credits, so they add up to zero. You can see that the 
processing logic of xbase is the same as our template method.
Some students may ask, why does Tianjian's template put it in the "purchase 
and construction of fixed assets" and put other cash flow projects it is 
not good? It may be for the convenience of inspection, because the 
construction of long-term asset payment of cash this subject, and the total 
debit exchange of each long-term asset check, if inconsistent, there may 
be a problem, it is easy to find problems. If it is put into "cash received 
from sales of goods", it is also OK, but there are too many factors affecting 
this item, if it cannot be checked, it will be difficult to find the reason. 
This is probably what the designers of xbase had in mind.
One more thing to keep in mind, what if the amount of the current account 
changes can't be accounted for by the credit impairment loss? The reason 
is that there is bad debt write-off. The entry of bad debt write-off is: 
debit bad debt reserve, credit receivables (other receivables). The debit's 
allowance for bad debts makes the change in the allowance for bad debts not 
equal to the amount of credit impairment loss. In fact, the lender's bad 
debt reserve can only be recorded with the credit impairment loss, that is, 
in the absence of bad debt write-off, the change in the bad debt reserve 
and credit impairment loss can only be recorded.
Therefore, in the case of bad debt write-off, we need to fill in a figure 
for bad debt write-off in xbase, and the figure of "cash paid for the purchase 
and construction of fixed assets, intangible assets and other long-term 
assets" in the analysis entries will be equal to the figure of credit 
impairment loss to "cash paid for the purchase and construction of fixed 
assets, intangible assets and other long-term assets".
In simple words, in the case of bad debt write-off, the change amount of 
bad debts should be rolled into the credit amount of bad debts, so that it 
can be offset with credit impairment losses.
And our template method is to put the credit amount of the bad debt reserve, 
and the corresponding asset impairment loss, together with the "credit 
impairment loss" project that does not affect the cash flow, this project 
should be equal to zero. It can be seen that the processing logic of our 
template method and xbase is the same, but the form of expression is 
different.
**②Fixed assets **
Xbase divides changes in fixed assets into changes in original value, changes 
in accumulated depreciation, and changes in provisions for impairment. Since 
the impairment provision is similar to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
and is rare, we can understand it by reference to the allowance for doubtful 
accounts.
** Change in original value **
In our template method, the original value of fixed assets is filled by debit 
and credit. Debit is filled with "cash paid for the purchase and construction 
of fixed assets, intangible assets and other long-term assets" and credit 
is filled with "net cash recovered from the disposal of fixed assets, 
intangible assets and other long-term assets".
In the analysis entry, the reverse rolling entry is rolled to "cash paid 
for the purchase and construction of fixed assets, intangible assets and 
other long-term assets". Therefore, as long as we fill in the credit amount 
in xbase, the analysis entry will cite it to "net cash recovered from the 
disposal of fixed assets, intangible assets and other long-term assets", 
then the final number rolled out is the debit amount. This result is the 
same as our template method.
** Accumulated depreciation change **
In our template method, accumulated depreciation is also filled in according 
to the borrower and credit, and the debit is filled in to "net cash recovered 
from disposal of fixed assets, intangible assets and other long-term assets"; 
The amount incurred by the credit is first added to the cost expense, and 
then added together to the "depreciation of fixed assets" that does not 
affect the cash flow item.
In the analysis entry of the xbase method, the backrolling item is rolled 
to "cash paid for the purchase and construction of fixed assets, intangible 
assets and other long-term assets", because neither the debit nor the credit 
of the depreciation will use this item, so this backrolling item must be 
equal to zero. Brother thinks that it can be optimized here by placing the 
reverse rolling item into the "net cash recovered from disposal of fixed 
assets, intangible assets and other long-term assets", so that we only need 
to fill in the accumulated depreciation of the credit on the line, and the 
debit will automatically roll to the corresponding place. Since the 
backrolled item has to be equal to zero, the amount of accumulated 
depreciation in both debits and credits has to be filled in in xbase. Enter 
the debit amount in xbase under "loss, sale, scrap, damage carried out." 
The amount of accumulated depreciation credit, how much is included in the 
cost, how much is included in the expense, the corresponding cost of the 
amount filled in "included in manufacturing expenses, production costs, 
other business costs and other cost items", the corresponding expense filled 
in "included in administrative expenses, sales expenses".
Assume that the accumulated depreciation debit amount is 600,000, the credit 
amount is 5 million, of which 3 million corresponds to the cost, 2 million 
corresponds to the expense, xbase filling method is as follows.

Once filled out, the analysis entry is shown below.
! [] (https://img.richfan.site/obsidian/xbase notes 
_5. Webp)
As we can see, the analytical entry is to put the accumulated depreciation 
recorded in costs into "cash paid for goods and services" with a negative 
number, and the depreciation recorded in expenses into "cash paid for other 
business activities" with a negative number. Since the latter main business 
costs, selling expenses and administrative expenses are also included in 
these two cash flow items, the negative number here will be offset by the 
positive number. In other words, depreciation and its corresponding costs 
are placed in the same project, the positive and negative signs are opposite, 
as long as they can be indexed, they can be automatically offset, 
depreciation itself does not involve cash flow, after offset, it does not 
affect cash flow, so this operation is correct.
Our template method also puts depreciation and corresponding cost into the 
same column, which is the same principle as xbase.
Through the filling method of the above two subjects, it can be found that 
our template method is the same principle as Tianjian's xbase! We are in 
a template to fill, according to the amount of filling. And xbase is also 
filled according to the amount, because the analysis of the entry in the 
reverse rolling can only roll one of the items, for those borrowers 
corresponding to different items, it is to fill in xbase, so as to be accurate. 
Therefore, the role of xbase is to correct the analysis entry, so that the 
cash flow presented in the analysis entry is consistent with the actual 
situation.
As for the other entries, I'll explain them in the video. If you learn our 
template method, and then learn Tianjian's xbase, it will be very, very easy, 
as long as the analysis entries are presented as we do in our template method.
In the same case, the little brother used xbase and template method 
respectively, and the result was the same. Therefore, when you learn, use 
the example I provide you, use xbase, follow my video to explain the operation 
again, you can master the use of xbase. Of course, you can use the examples 
from your company if you want.
(3) Analysis entry (Comprehensive analysis)
Analysis entry (Comprehensive analysis) This table is automatically 
generated, according to the understanding of the little brother, it is to 
synthesize the previous "analysis entry", called "comprehensive analysis", 
such as "cash received from the sale of goods and services", the accounts 
receivable, advance receipts, value-added tax, business income, etc. 
related to this project are integrated together. We can see "cash received 
from sales of goods and services" is caused by what projects, the main role 
is this, because the analysis of the entry is too scattered, difficult to 
find.
If we use our template method to understand, it is equivalent to extracting 
all the vertical figures of each cash flow item in our template method, and 
it is helpful to see which balance sheet items are formed for each cash flow 
item.
This table is mainly used for analysis, automatic generation, so generally 
do not care.
Another point is that the analytical entry (comprehensive analysis) is more 
like the method introduced in the elementary and intermediate accounting 
practice textbooks, that is, the working paper method. Because the logic 
of the working paper method is not very clear, many students feel that cash 
flow is difficult. Junior's courseware also has a special explanation of 
the logic of working paper method and compilation methods. After decoding 
these methods, you will find that in fact, the logic behind all methods is 
the same. It is too simple to compile cash flow flatly, and it is no problem 
to compile accurately and pass various questions of quality control.
(4) Supplementary entries
Through the previous explanation, we know that the logic of xbase is: the 
formula in the analysis entry has been able to automatically generate a flat 
cash flow statement, but it is not accurate, xbase table is to correct it, 
so that it tends to be accurate. However, some of the more special subjects, 
even xbase can not be corrected, we can also be corrected by supplementing 
entries. For example, using the consolidated balance sheet, income statement 
and notes to prepare the consolidated cash flow statement, there is the 
purchase of subsidiaries, disposal of subsidiaries, xbase can not solve, 
can only be adjusted by analyzing the entries.
(5) Cash flow statement
The cash flow statement is automatically generated and its take-up is derived 
from the analytical entries. Therefore, when we want to check whether the 
cash flow statement is accurate, as long as we check the analysis entry, 
combined with the account balance table, every item of the analysis entry 
is checked. As long as the analysis entry is accurate, the cash flow statement 
is accurate.
(6) Supplementary information
Supplementary information, also known as the schedule. Our template method 
can be automatically generated, and xbase can be automatically generated, 
but the logic of xbase is not as clear as our template method. Therefore, 
you can use the logic in our template method to understand the logic of xbase.
Because the supplementary information is calculated from net profit to net 
cash flow from operating activities, those who have studied the template 
method know that net cash flow from operating activities = profit recorded 
in cash from operating activities + balance sheet account recorded in cash 
from operating activities.
Therefore, as long as we ensure that all non-operating profits and all 
balance sheet items recorded in cash from operating activities are reflected 
in the supplementary information, then the supplementary information must 
be flat.
The logic of Tianjian's method of generating supplementary information is 
not very rigorous, and it may be uneven when it comes to some special items. 
Therefore, when it is found that the schedule is uneven, it will take a look 
at ** non-operating net profit, and the balance sheet account ** recorded 
in cash from operating activities, and who is not reflected in the 
supplementary information. These items can be found in the analytical entry, 
or in the table of the analytical entry (comprehensive analysis)
